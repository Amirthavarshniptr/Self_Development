REACT notes:

- open source library,not a framework.
- has component based arch - header, footer,

- Browser - Document object model (DOM)
- Vanilla Javascript - without any tools

- Use components and DOM

- npx create-react-app my-react-app
- cd my-react-app
- npm start

- If you have a funtional component within a folder - have "export default function-name"
- Without this we can also give export with the function itself.
- try using functional components over class components
