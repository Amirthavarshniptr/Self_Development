- Comment out many lines together: cmd+k+c
- console.log() -> more like print
- document.getElementbyID("id") to get the info in the id
- document.getElementbyID("id").textContent = or .innertext =
- for assigning - let, for changing the variable, just use the variable without any prefix
- if(condition){} else if (condition) else...
- In condition, the equals checker should be "===". "==" is less strict and leaves if it is a string. Say 100 == "100" would be true
- To specify an id within a querySelector or within css, #id would be used. ".id" could be used as well.
- Length of a list -> listname.length
- adding to the last -> push (instead of append)
- pop is same as pop
- cmd/alt+d -> to write the same thing in several places
- Methods are added similar to arrays with a let->let player = {
    name: "Per",
    sayHello: function() {
        console.log("Heisann!")
    }}
- we can call it as player.sayHello()
