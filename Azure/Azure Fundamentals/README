## Cloud computing:

- Computing services over internet
- VM, storage, dbs, networking, IOT, ML & AI
- No need to build a new data centre
- pay for just the services we use.

### Compute power - as we need it

## Shared responsibility model

- Correct version, IT dept - infra running
- Consumer - responsible for data, access
- Cloud sql database - responsible, cloud provider
- But data in the database - consumer responsibility
- On-premise datacentre - responsible for everything

## Cloud service types

- IAAS - Infrastructure as a Service - most responsibility on constomer
- PaaS - Platform as a Service - evenly distributed
- SaaS - Software as a Service - most responsibility on provider

## Cloud Models

- Private: natural evolution from a corporate - dedicated datacentre
- Public: third party cloud provider
- Hybrid: both in inter-connected environments. which in public and private
- Multi-cloud: Multiple features from different cloud providers

## Azure Arc

- Set of technologies that help manage cloud env.

## Azure VMWare

- Used to run VMWARE workloads with integration in private cloud

# Consumption - based model

- Capital Expenditure
- Operational Expenditure

- Cloud pricing models - pay as you go pricing model - manage operating costs.

# Benefits of Cloud

## High Availibility & Scalability

- Uptime (availability) & ability to handle demand (Scale)
- Uptimes guarentees based on SLAs (Service Level Agreements)

### SLA - for uptime

- Agreement between IT dept and business users
- Azure SLAs are based on % - credit entitled when there is a downtime
- Usually SLAs 99% to 99.99%
- 99% can be upto 1.6 hours per week - which is 7.9 hrs per month
- 99.9% - just 10 mins per week
- Depends on the business needs

### Scalability

- Ability to adjust resources when demanded.
- Vertical Scaling: we can add more CPUs or RAM to VM when we need more processing power (scale up). Or conversely, scale down by reducing specs
- Horizontal Scaling: steep jump in demand - deployed resources can be scaled out or scaled in. Here scaled in means reducing and scaled out means adding additional VMs or containers.

## Reliability & Predictability

### Reliability

- Recover failures and continue to function
- Decentralized design - reliable and resilient infrastructure

### Predictability

- Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework
- Performance: Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability
- Cost: track resources in real0time. TCO - Total cost of ownership tools or pricing calc to get an estimate of potential cloud spent

## Security & Governance

- Cloud-based auditing - flags resources out of compliance with corporate standards
- In terms of security - IaaS - maximum control of security to customers - have to do patches & maintenance. PaaS and SaaS - patches & maintenance taken care automatiically.
- Cloud providers handle things like - Distributed Denial of Service Attacks - making network more robust and secure

## Manageability

- Automatically scale resource deployment, have template and hence remove manual config
- Monitor health, replace failing resources, performance realtime is automatically alerted
- Can manage through web portal, CLI, APIs, Powershell

# Cloud Service types

## IaaS

- Most flexible - maximum control
- Physical - cloud service provider
- Everything else - consumer - OS installation, config, maintenance, etc.

### Scenarios used

- Lift & shift migration - from on-prem datacenter to IaaS
- Testing & dev - replicate configs

## PaaS

- Middle ground b/w iaas and saas.
- Maintenance & physical - cloud service provider
- network settings, connectivity, etc- depends
- Data, info and accounts - consumer

### Scenarios used

- Development framework: develop or customize cloud based apps
- Analytics/ business intel: Datamining, forecasting, etc.

## SaaS

- Renting a fully dev app
- Easiest deployment
- except info, data, accounts, etc., everything is by cloud provider

### Scenarios used

- Email and messaging.
- Business productivity applications.
- Finance and expense tracking.
